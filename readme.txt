Extension for the [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets) plugin which will stop snippets from running.

== Description ==

If you have just activated a snippet and now your entire site has crashed, leaving only a white screen or an error message, don't panic! This plugin is built to help you out in this situation.

While this plugin is active, all snippets will be temporarily 'paused', allowing you to access your site and deactivate the snippet that is causing the error.

When you're confident things are ship-shape once again, deactivate this plugin. Feel free to delete it if you like a clean-looking plugins list, or keep it handy â€“ just in case.
